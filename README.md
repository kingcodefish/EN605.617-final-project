# EN605.617 - Final Project

Author: Lucius Latham

### Motivation

End-to-end test tooling is traditionally language-specific and heavily dependent on a reference system for UI elements to simulate events. This project attempts to integrate computer vision into this process through a recording and playback tool that captures events visually and reproduces the events through an interpreted language.
